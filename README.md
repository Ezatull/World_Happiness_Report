World Happiness Report Analysis
This GitHub repository contains an analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset, exploring various factors that contribute to global happiness levels. The analysis involves data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory data visualization using Python's pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries.
Introduction: The World Happiness Report annually evaluates and dissects happiness levels across countries. Beyond rankings, the report is a narrative that unveils happiness drivers, including economic indicators, life expectancy, social support, freedom, and more. This repository delves into this intricate narrative, aiming to uncover patterns and insights.
Contents:
Data Preparation and Cleaning: Utilizing pandas, the dataset is loaded, explored, and missing values are handled. Columns related to economic indicators, life expectancy, freedom, and more are examined.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Seaborn and matplotlib are employed to visualize correlations and distributions. Descriptive statistics, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots showcase relationships between variables.
Key Findings:
The mean "Life Ladder" score across countries indicates moderate life satisfaction.
Countries with high "Log GDP per capita" tend to have elevated well-being.
Freedom is positively correlated with GDP and life satisfaction.
The analysis highlights countries facing significant health challenges, notably Haiti, Zimbabwe, and others.
Afghanistan's happiness indicators exhibit a distressing decline due to conflict and instability.
